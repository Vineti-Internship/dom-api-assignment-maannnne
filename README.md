## Feedback
- If a variable is not going to be reassigned preffer to use `cosnt` instead of `let`
- Do not use math operations for string opperations(i.e. `big.right - smallBallRadius + 'px';` should have been written as `` `${big.right - smallBallRadius}px` ``)
- It's preffered to not use space between HTML tag attribute equal(=) signs
- Cleanup unused code blocks or `console.log` as a wrap-up
- Overall pay attantion to code style. ([For Reference](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript))
